                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My full name is <strong>Ramy Issa AL-Nashar</strong>,
                        my date of birth is 13/12/2000, I live in the city of Rafah,
                        since my childhood and I love engineering, programming and the computer world
                        . This is what prompted me to enroll in the Faculty of Engineering and Information
                        Technology at Al-Azhar University. Currently, I am in the fourth level, the first semester,
                        which is about to end, as I am supposed to be in the fourth level, the second semester,
                        but I was late for a semester because of the difficult financial situation that made me I am
                        postponing
                        a semester and don't know if the financial circumstances will allow me to register next year or
                        not,During
                        these school years, I have a good programming background
                        I also mentioned that I love programming and always strive to develop myself in this field and
                        learn as much
                        as possible
                        to reach the stage that I have sufficient knowledge. There is no doubt that this work is
                        developing and this
                        is the reason
                        why I love The field and I want to increase my knowledge and abilities myself, but when
                        self-learning
                        sometimes I do not
                        continue and interrupt, and this is one of the reasons that prompted me to register in this
                        academy.<br><br>
                        <strong>Why do I want to enroll in this program</strong><br>
                        I would like to join this program because, as I mentioned,
                        I am a software engineering major and I want to learn more to become a professional in my field,
                        This program allows me to learn and follow along with you. Because I also want to complete my
                        studies, that
                        is, if I am accepted in this program, I will be able to enter the labor market, which will make
                        me save my
                        tuition fees and I also have a goal that I want to see the labor market and learn from it
                        As much as possible and understand how local and international companies operate to gain
                        experience that
                        will
                        Let me in the future build my own team or company and this experience doesn't even come
                        After the practice and for it to work, I must have sufficient knowledge that qualifies me and
                        It opens the way for all of these goals, and I see this program providing me with that
                        knowledge. </br>
